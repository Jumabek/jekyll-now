**3 Common Objections:**

1. **It is a fundamental technology**
No it is a source of entertainment like a slot machine. It offers shiny treats in exchange for our time & data.
They are built upon attention engineering, designed to make us addictive 

2. **It is vital for my success** (AKA, it helps me for professional success w/ network/connections)
In a competitive economy, rare and valuable skill/product is cherished.
Social media (SM) use is easy to replicate and does not produce any high value. If you can write elegant algorithm, or if you use statistics to produce high quality, well organized insights from big data, then people will find you.

3. **It is harmless** 
Social media brings multiple well-documented harms.
 - Harms professional success - if you spend large portions of your day with fragmented attention (due to constantly breaking your attention and checking up instagram, etc.), this can permanently reduce your capacity for concentration. Capacity for concentration is what exactly is needed in todayâ€™s economy.  
 - There is psychological harms. More people use SM, more likely they feel lonely or isolated. Constant exposure to your friends carefully curated positive portrayal of their life makes you feel inadequate and depressed.
 - There is a fundamental mismatch between these technologies and how our brains are wired. As a result this short-circuits to our brain which in turn leads to serious cognitive consequences: Pervasive background home of anxiety. Along w/ the rise of social media use, came an explosion of anxiety related disorders (Mental Health experts in College Campuses)

**What life is like w/o social media**

1. **First 2 weeks can be uncomfortable**

2. **After that, two things will happen:**
High productivity. If you treat your attention with respect and do not fragment it. This leads to higher intensity work with concentration, which leads to getting things done in a shorter amount of time w/ better quality. Peaceful & restorative life outside of work: Reading newspaper while sun is coming up, reading hardcover books after kids sleep, listening to baseball on the radio.
